# DHIS2 Dockerized Server

## Pre-requisites

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Mac or Windows) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) on Linux
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (included with **Docker Desktop** on Mac and Windows)
* **OPTIONAL** A DHIS2 database `.sql` or `.sql.gz` dump compatible with the version of DHIS2 you will be installing (such as the [Sierra Leone demo db](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-demo-db/tree/master/sierra-leone))

## Setup

First, seed the database with some dummy data (**optional**):

```bash
> ./scripts/seed.sh <path/to/seedfile.sql.gz>
```

**Note** that once the server is up and running you will need to export Analytics Tables in the [Data Administration app](http://localhost:8080/dhis-web-data-administration/index.action#/analytics).  This must be run as a system user and can take some time to complete.

## Basic Usage

Once the containers have been built and the database seeded you can start the cluster:

```bash
> ./scripts/start.sh
```

_(it may take a couple minutes for the Java server to initialize)_

Once started, the services should automatically restart if Docker or the host machine are restarted.

You can stop the services manually:

```bash
> ./scripts/stop.sh
```

Or destroy the Docker images and all database data (which is stored in a Docker-managed [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) on the host system):

```bash
> ./scripts/clean.sh
```

## Advanced Usage

By default, `start.sh` will pull the image [amcgee/dhis2-core:dev-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/amcgee/dhis2-core/tags/) from Docker Hub.  You can specify a custom image tag (though not a custom image at this time) with the environment variable `DHIS2_CORE_TAG`, for example:

```sh
> DHIS2_CORE_TAG=2.31-rc1-alpine ./scripts/start.sh
```

By default, `start.sh` will expose the DHIS2 Core instance at port 8080.  This can be customized with the environment variable `DHIS2_CORE_PORT`, for example:

```sh
> DHIS2_CORE_PORT=8888 ./scripts/start.sh
```

These environment variables can also be specified int the `.env` file

### Multiple backend instances

It is possible to run multiple instances of the DHIS2 backend cluster on the same machine.  Since `docker-compose` uses the name of the directory as the project namespace for a cluster, it is currently necessary to keep separate copies of the `dhis2-backend` repo with different directory names, such as `backend` and `backend-231rc1`.  With this setup and using the environment variables above to select a core version tag and specify non-conflicting ports it is possibel to run multiple versions of the backend simultaneously.

## Configuration and Logs

The `DHIS2_home` directory on the `core` container is mapped to the directory `./config/DHIS2_home`, so you can put configuration there as well as view DHIS2 system logs.  This directory is **NOT** deleted when running `clean.sh`.  The `dhis.conf` file is required to exist and by default has the following contents (note the database connection parameters):

```conf
connection.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
connection.driver_class = org.postgresql.Driver
connection.url = jdbc:postgresql://db/dhis2
connection.username = dhis
connection.password = dhis
# Database schema behavior, can be validate, update, create, create-drop
connection.schema = update

encryption.password = xxxx
metadata.audit.persist = on
```

## Accessing your new server

Once the container is running:

* Your DHIS2 instance will be accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
